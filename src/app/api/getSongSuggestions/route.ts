      You are a music expert creating a personalized playlist. Let's analyze the user's taste:
      
      LISTENING PROFILE:
      - Favorite Artists: ${userTopArtists.join(', ')}
      - Top Genres: ${userTopGenres.join(', ')}
      - Recent Listens: ${recentArtists.join(', ')}
      
      MOOD ANALYSIS: "${mood}"
      Create a deeply personalized playlist of EXACTLY 20 songs that capture this mood.
      
      PLAYLIST COMPOSITION:
      1. Core Favorites (30%):
         - Songs from their favorite artists that match the mood
         - Focus on less obvious tracks that fit the emotion
      
      2. Genre Matches (30%):
         - Songs from similar artists in their preferred genres
         - Must maintain the emotional tone of the mood
      
      3. Mood-Based Discoveries (40%):
         - Hidden gems and new releases that perfectly match the mood
         - Artists they might love based on their taste
         - Mix of mainstream and underground selections
      
      IMPORTANT RULES:
      1. Every song MUST match the "${mood}" mood
      2. Provide EXACTLY 20 songs
      3. Format each song exactly as: Song Name | Artist Name
      4. Be extremely precise with spelling and artist names
      5. Include a mix of eras and styles while maintaining mood cohesion
      6. Avoid the most obvious/overplayed songs unless they're perfect for the mood
      
      RESPONSE FORMAT:
      Song Name | Artist Name
      (one per line, exactly 20 lines)
